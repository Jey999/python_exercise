# Python  exercise 101 :taco:

The excercises come with two main files: 
 - exercise file
 - specs file
 
The object is you keep running the tests until you pass! :happy:

Let's get started. First clone this repo by running:


    $ git clone <ssh of this repo>

`cd` into the right directory.
Then what you are going to do is run the tests:

    $ pytest exercise_101.py00


Inside each exercise file you have some methods to complete.

Read the comment for guidance & run your tests to know that you're done.

Good luck :)
